This project is a simple graphql server. Clients are able to perform CRUD operations. The server stores the data to a mongodb cloud database.

<b>Built with</b>

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Graphql](https://graphql.org/)
- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Installation

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Clone this repo by running

```
git clone https://github.com/michaelbusho/graphql.git
```

3. Navigate into the newly cloned repo and install Node packages by running

```
npm install
```

4. Create a file, named nodemon.json on the root folder and structure it like the nodemon_example.json. Then fill in the required env values.

| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| PORT           | Port Where the server should run                         |
| MONGO_USER     | Mongodb Atlas Username                                   |
| MONGO_PASSWORD | Mongodb Atlas Password                                   |
| MONGO_DATABASE | Mongodb Atlas Database Name                              |
| HASH_SALT      | Integer to denote number of salt when hashing a password |
| JWT_KEY        | JWT key to sign jwt tokens                               |
| TOKEN_LIFE     | How long should each jwt token live                      |
|                |                                                          |

5. Run server on watch mode

```
npm run start:demon
```

<sup>\* You will need to create a [mongo db cloud atlas account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and generate the credentials</sup>

## API Reference

The API offers graphql queries and mutations for 3 different models. Users, Locations and Appearances.

### Users:

```graphql
type User {
	_id: ID!
	rfid: String!
	role: Roles!
	permissions: [String!]!
	email: String!
	password: String
	name: String!
	lastName: String!
	health_status: HealthStatus!
	address: String
	phone_number: String
	image: String
}
```

User Queries:

```graphql
findUserByRfid(rfid: String!): User!
users: [User]!
login(email: String!, password: String!): AuthData!
```

User Mutations:

```graphql
createUser(UserInput: UserInput): User
updateUser(userID: ID!, UserInput: UserInputUpdate): User
deleteUser(userID: ID!): User
```

### Locations:

```graphql
type Location {
	_id: ID!
	name: String!
	capacity: Int!
	address: String
	phone_number: String
	email: String
	description: String
}
```

Location Queries:

```graphql
locations: [Location]
findLocationById(location_id: String!): Location
```

Location Mutations:

```graphql
createLocation(LocationInput: LocationInput): Location
updateLocation(locationID: ID!, LocationInput: LocationInputUpdate): Location
deleteLocation(locationID: ID!): Location
```

### Appearances:

```graphql
type Appearance {
	_id: ID!
	location: Location!
	user: User!
	createdAt: String
}
```

Appearance Queries:

```graphql
findUserAppearances(user_id: String!): [Appearance]
findLocationAppearances(location_id: String!): [Appearance]
```

Appearance Mutations:

```graphql
createAppearance(user_id: String!, location_id: String!): Appearance
deleteAppearance(appearanceID: ID!): Appearance
```

The requests are authenticated and certain actions/requests are restricted and available only to authorized user roles. The API uses a JWT token to achieve this. The query login() returns a valid JWT token upon authentication. The token is valid for a predefined lifespan.

User passwords are hashed using bcrypt.

## Tests

Unit tests are performed using cypress. To run the unit tests and generate test coverage reports simply run

```
npm test
```

The terminal will show the results of the tests. The folder cypress/coverage contains the coverage reports. Simply open cypress/coverage/Icov-report/index.html in a browser. To run the tests in a cypress browser run

```
npm run test:browser
```

If you are using vscode and you wish to run the server on debug mode create a launch.json file inside the .vscode folder and structure it like the launch_sample.json. The env variables should be the same as in the nodemon.json.
